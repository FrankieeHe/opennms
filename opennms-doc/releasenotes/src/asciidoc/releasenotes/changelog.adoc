==== Release 24.0.0

Release 24.0.0 is the latest stable release of OpenNMS.
It contains a large number of bug fixes and enhancements, most notably adding support for real-time telemetry flow processing.
For a high-level overview of what's changed in OpenNMS 24, see link:http://docs.opennms.org/opennms/releases/24.0.0/releasenotes/releasenotes.html#releasenotes-24[What's New in OpenNMS 24].

The codename for 24.0.0 is _TODO NOT DEFINED YET_.

===== Breaking Changes

* The NCS-Alarm page and the NCS-Topology-Plugin have been removed. See issue HZN-1422.
* The usage of `config:edit` may be changed. This affects all configuration edits, where the configuration consists a `-`,
  e.g. `org.opennms.features.telemetry.listeners-udp-50003`. See "Karaf configuration Command changed" for more details.
* The _Plugin Manager_ is no longer available.
  Features or bundles should be installed via the Karaf Shell.
* The `HttpService` can no longer be consumed.
  This will only affect custom implementations of HTTP Servlets and Resources, but only if they are exposed via `httpServices.register(...)`.
  If you need those, please expose the according services via the OSGi Service Registration.
  Refer to the  link:https://osgi.org/specification/osgi.cmpn/7.0.0/service.http.whiteboard.html[OSGi Http Whiteboard Specification] for more details.
* Exposing Servlets follow now the OSGi Specification.
  Refer to the  link:https://osgi.org/specification/osgi.cmpn/7.0.0/service.http.whiteboard.html[OSGi Http Whiteboard Specification] for more details.
* Properties to expose Vaadin Applications have changed:
   ** `init.widgetset` becomes `servlet.init.widgetset`
   ** `alias` becomes `osgi.http.whiteboard.servlet.pattern`
* We upgrade the Karaf Container to 4.2.3 and with that, the `users.properties` have changed. Ensure that the `admingroup` in `${OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/users.properties` contains the role `ssh`. If unsure link:https://github.com/OpenNMS/opennms/blob/release-24.0.0/container/karaf/src/main/filtered-resources/etc/users.properties[here] is the default one.

====== Karaf Configuration Command changed

In 24.0.0 we updates to a newer version of Apache Karaf.
With that the `config:edit` command syntax changed in some cases.
This affects all configuration edits, where the configuration consists a `-`,  e.g. `org.opennms.features.telemetry.listeners-udp-50003`.
If you are using Minion or Sentinel, you will most likely be affected (e.g. for Telemetry Listeners/Adapters).

The old format:

----
config:edit org.opennms.features.telemetry.listeners-udp-50003
config:property-set key value
config:update
----

The new format

----
config:edit --alias udp-50003 --factory org.opennms.features.telemetry.listeners
config:property-set key value
config:update
----
